       <div id= "Introduction">
       <p id= "Who">Hello! My name is Isaiah Ballard, and I'm a 16 year old upcoming junior at Talent Unlimited High School. Outside school I tend to participate in extracurricular activites such as afterschool clubs and summer jobs like SYEP. Just recently, I've joined the All Star Code program so I can further understand the basics of different coding commands and what softwares I should use. In the future, I plan on being a graphic design engineer working for Google and possibly create a video game. And I also want to start a band and be a famous musician. Fun Fact: I'm currently starting a band called "Desolate Archangel, and I love bands like Metallica, Testament, Sepultura and Type O Negative. I also love playing video games like Sonic, Fornite and Ghost of Tsushima".</p>
